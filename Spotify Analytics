-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

-- Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

-- Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM Spotifydata;

--1. Select the Top 10 Popular Artists and their track names
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10;


--2. Determine the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name,
    AVG(popularity) AS ave_popularity,
    AVG(danceability) AS ave_danceability,
    AVG(energy) AS ave_energy
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;


--3. Select songs with the lowest danceability including the artist name
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability ASC LIMIT 10;


--4. Select the song with the lowest energy
SELECT track_name, artist_name, energy
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy LIMIT 1;


--5. Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”
CREATE VIEW vwPopularityAverage AS
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS ave_popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;


SELECT * FROM vwPopularityAverage;

SELECT artist_name, ave_popularity,
'Top Star' AS tag
FROM vwPopularityAverage
WHERE ave_popularity>=90;
